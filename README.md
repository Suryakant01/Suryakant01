## About Me

I'm a computer science enthusiast currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE at Galgoitas University. I've got a passion for crafting sleek and user-friendly interfaces, so you can call me the frontend maestro! But hey, I don't stop there. I've got my sights set on becoming a full-stack wizard and an Android app guru. 🧙‍♂️

## My Magical Skills 🪄

- **Frontend Sorcery**: I wield HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create delightful and interactive web experiences. My code is so clean; it makes a freshly swept floor jealous.

- **Java Juggler**: I'm not just brewing coffee with Java; I'm crafting software that runs on it. Object-oriented programming is my playground.

- **Full-Stack Aspirations**: Watch out world, because I'm on a mission to conquer the back end as well. Databases, servers, APIs – I'm coming for you!

- **Android Alchemist**: Android Studio is my cauldron, and I'm conjuring up mobile apps with a sprinkle of UX magic.
